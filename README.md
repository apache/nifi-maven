## Requirements
* JDK 1.7 or higher
* Apache Maven 3.1.0 or higher

## Getting Started

Building the nifi-nar-maven-plugin module should be rare since it will be released infrequently compared to
the main 'nifi' code tree.

- Build with `mvn clean install`
- Presuming you need to make use of changes to the nifi-nar-maven-plugin module, you should next
  go to the [nifi](../nifi) directory and follow its instructions. 


## Settings and configuration

There are several properties that can be set to change the behavior of this plugin.
Two of special interest are:

####type
type defines the type of archive to be produced and evaluated for special dependencies.  The default type is nar.  This property should be changed if you have need to 
customize the file extension of archives produced by this plugin.  This plugin will build archives with .nar extentions, and look for othe .nar dependencies by definition.
Changing this value, for example to 'foo', will have the effect of having the plugin produce archives with .foo as the extension, and look for .foo files
as nar dependencies.
 
####packageIDPrefix 
The archives produced by this plugin have the following entries added to the manifest ( where packageIDPrefix defaults to 'Nar'):

-  {packageIDPrefix}-Id
-  {packageIDPrefix}-Group
-  {packageIDPrefix}-Version
-  {packageIDPrefix}-Dependency-Group
-  {packageIDPrefix}-Dependency-Id
-  {packageIDPrefix}-Dependency-Version

This property can be used to change the name of these manifest entries.  One convention being to continue as the original by capitalizing the
type, such as:
Nar to nar
